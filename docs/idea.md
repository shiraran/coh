# Chainblade Tactics – Core Idea

Chainblade Tactics is a swift-paced, lane-based puzzle battler built specifically for iPhone (with responsive iPad layout) that fuses the strategic depth of Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes with the fusion mechanics of Legend of Solgard. Players rearrange units on an 8×6 pixel-art board to set up vertical strikes and horizontal fortifications, watching fused attackers surge forward to crush the opposing gate in a cascade of satisfying collisions.

Key pillars:
- **Tactical Matching:** Every drag-drop decision sets up combos rather than clearing tiles, creating forward momentum and defensive structures.
- **Countdown Payoff:** Fused attackers store potential energy that releases after a short countdown, rewarding planning ahead of enemy turns.
- **Mirrored Battlefields:** Head-to-head structure keeps clarity high—players always see what the AI is plotting across the gap.
- **Lean Production:** Pixel-art sprites (32×32 / 48×48) and a focused unit roster enable a playable core quickly, leaving room to expand later.
